Sandworld - A sandbox game, but bigger.
################################################################################

Compiling
=========
To compile sandworld you'll need a C compiler, the ncurses library and
SCons. Running `scons` should build the program. If you do not wish to
install SCons, a simple `gcc *.c -lncurses` should do the trick. After
you successfully compile sandworld you can just type `./sandworld`.

it. Here's some basic controls.
